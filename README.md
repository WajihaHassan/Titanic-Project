# Titanic-Project
Analysis and visualization of titanic data set to know which people survived the tragedy.

Summary:
The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

We have made a dataset of total of 891 pessengers and predicted their chance of survival

Survival: 0 Dead, 1 Survived
Sex: Male, Female
Passenger Class: I,II,III

To Summarise the visualisation, more females than males survived in Passenger class 1 then Passenger class 2 then Passenger class 3.

Design:
The visualisation design is kept simple. Using Bar Charts and few buttons the whole analysis has been presented.
Passenger survival count is analysed using Sex, Age and Passenger Class. 
Graph shows a dimension with its survival rate.

Feedback:

Feedback1:
Color scheme chosen for survived and dead can be revised. Dead could be resresented by a darker color while survived with a slightly lighter color.
Response1:
Color scheme selection is revised in the new chart.

Feedback2: 
The categories on X axis are not consistent. the color scheme chosen for survived and dead counts is not differentiating. 
Response2:
The color scheme adjusted and X ais categories are aligned for all charts.

Feedback3:
Along with counts, percentages should also be visible. this will give viewers a better understanding of overall picture versus exact counts
Response3:
Two buttons for counts and percentages are added for better understanding and interaction.
